      <h1>The Perfect Trip</h1>
      <h2>Where would you go</h2>
      
        <p> If I were to have a perfect trip the best place where I would like to go would be japan mainly so I can experience the culture. Ive been in love with the idea of going to Japan for a long time and just thinking about the adventure I would have there fill me with the upmost joy.

      <h2>Animals to see</h2>
        <p>
          As for animals that I'd want to see im not familiar with the ecosystem of japan so im not too sure as to what to expect for animals to encounter per se if I go out to a safarir type of excursion. I will say that I've heard the wildlife is one of a kind and can't be found nowhere else!
