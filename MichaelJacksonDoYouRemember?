    <h1>Remember the Time?</h1>
    <h2>Do you remember?</h2>
    <h3>Lryics:</h3>
    <P>
I don't know, bet you wanna try <br>
Every time you see <br>
Do you remember <br>
When we fell in love? <br>
We were young and innocent then <br>
Do you remember<br>
How it all began?<br>
It just seemed like heaven, so why did it end?<br>
Do you remember<br>
Back in the fall?<br>
We'd be together all day long<br>
Do you remember<br>
Us holding hands?<br>
In each other's eyes, we'd stare<br>
Tell me<br>
Do you remember the time<br>
When we fell in love? <br>
Do you remember the time <br>
When we first met, girl? <br>
Do you remember the time <br>
When we fell in love? <br>
Do you remember the time <br>
Do you remember <br>
How we used to talk? <br>
You know <br>
We'd stay on the phone at night 'til dawn <br>
Do you remember <br>
All the things we said? <br>
Like, I love you so, I'll never let you go <br>
Do you remember <br>
Back in the Spring? <br>
Every morning birds would sing <br>
Do you remember <br>
Those special times? <br>
They'll just go on and on <br>
In the back of my mind <br>
Do you remember the time <br>
When we fell in love? <br>
Do you remember the time <br>
When we first met, girl? <br>
Do you remember the time <br>
When we fell in love? <br>
Do you remember the time <br>
Those sweet memories <br>
Will always be dear to me <br>
And girl, no matter what was said <br>
I will never forget what we had <br>
Now baby<br>
Do you remember the time <br>
When we fell in love? <br>
Do you remember the time <br>
When we first met, girl? <br>
Do you remember the time (oh, I) <br>
When we fell in love? <br>
Do you remember the time <br>
(Remember, my baby) <br>
Do you remember the time ('cause I remember) <br>
When we fell in love? <br>
Do you remember the time <br>
(All in my mind, girl) <br>
Do you remember the time (oh, I) <br>
When we fell in love? <br>
Do you remember the time <br>
(Remember, my baby) <br>
Remember the time <br>
Woo <br>
Remember the time <br>
Do you remember, girl? <br>
Remember the time <br>
On the phone, you and me <br>
Remember the time? <br>
'Til dawn, two or three <br>
What about us, girl? <br>
Remember the time <br>
Do you, do you, do you, do you, do you <br>
Remember the time <br>
In the park, on the beach <br>
Remember the time <br>
You and me in Spain <br>
What about, what about <br>
Remember the time <br>
Remember the time <br>
Ooh, in the park <br>
Remember the time <br>
After dark <br>
Do you, do you, do you <br>
Remember the time <br>
Do you, do you, do you, do you <br>
Remember the time <br>
Yeah, yeah, woo <br>
Remember the time</P>
